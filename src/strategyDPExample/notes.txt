Strategy DP comes under the behaviour Design Pattern.
Behavior design pattern talks about the internal implementation of a particular DP - strategy.
So basically the internal impl differs based on the strategy we choose. ex: myntra payment gateway(cash on delivery, UPI, credit/debit card etc.) / google maps (By Bike, By Car, By walk)
In Strategy design pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies. And which strategy will get executed, depends on the user input during runtime.
